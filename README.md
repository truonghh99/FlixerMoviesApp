# Project 2 - *FLixster*

**Flixster** shows the latest movies currently playing in theaters. The app utilizes the Movie Database API to display images and basic information about these movies to the user.

Time spent: **23** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can **scroll through current movies** from the Movie Database API
* [x] Display a nice default [placeholder graphic](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#advanced-usage) for each image during loading
* [x] For each movie displayed, user can see the following details:
  * [x] Title, Poster Image, Overview (Portrait mode)
  * [x] Title, Backdrop Image, Overview (Landscape mode)
* [x] Allow user to view details of the movie including ratings and popularity within a separate activity

The following **stretch** features are implemented:

* [x] Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
* [x] Apply rounded corners for the poster or background images using [Glide transformations](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#transformations)
* [x] Apply the popular [View Binding annotation library](http://guides.codepath.org/android/Reducing-View-Boilerplate-with-ViewBinding) to reduce boilerplate code.
* [x] Allow video trailers to be played in full-screen using the YouTubePlayerView from the details screen.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] Add a searchbar for user to search movies from the current list
* [x] Add the ability to sort movie list based on rating / release date
* [x] Add a customized library
  * [x] Create a storage class to store selected movies 
  * [x] Create a separate activity to show library when requested
  * [x] Allow user to modify their library (add and delete movies)
* [x] Add the ability to authenticate user
  * [x] Add Login & Register activity
  * [x] Connect to Firebase to store users' information

## Notes

This is the first time I've ever used database. Even though Firebase is user friendly, the experience as a whole is definitely challenging. I've also had a tough time exploring the toolbar and menu items, yet I'm glad that I finally got a general idea of how to deal with those things. 

## Open-source libraries usedI 

- [Android Async HTTP](https://github.com/loopj/android-async-http) - Simple asynchronous HTTP requests with JSON parsing
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) - Image loading and caching library for Android
